**Inturion:**
* Divide num1 and num2 into 2 parts say l1,r2 and l2,r2 su ch that l1 + r1 = num1 and  l2 + r2 = num2.
* The rangre low to high represents the value of (l1 + l2).
* we have to choose l1, l2, r1, r2, such that last element of l1 <= first element of r2 and last element of l2 <= first element of r1.
* cut1 repesents size of l1 and cut2 represents size of l2.
